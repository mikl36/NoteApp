# This project is a Note App for Android (Android Studio), developed as a course project. It is designed as a basic note-taking application with the potential for extensibility to support everyday use. The current version includes basic weather-fetching capabilities. Weather data is fetched from Openweathermap api. The app is built using Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Android, and utilizes a Room database for data storage.
